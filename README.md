In medical image analysis the area of expert annotation has been long known, but little research has been done on predicting expert gaze data in ultrasound images. The Oxford University multidisciplinary study named PULSE (Perception Ultrasound by Learning Sonographic Experience) gathered both the expert gaze data and corresponding ultrasound videos which enabled such study to be conducted. 

For the task of gaze data prediction two Convolutional Neural Networks: U-Net and Resnet50 were applied. This Master's Thesis discusses the theory behind the Convolutional Neural Networks, describes the process of preparing data, training and testing both models. At the end the modelsâ€™ performance is compared and the possibilities of further research are discussed.
